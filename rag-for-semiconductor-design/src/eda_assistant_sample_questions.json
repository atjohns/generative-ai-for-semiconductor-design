    "question1": "Elaborate in detail how I can optimize timing paths for a RISC-V core",
    "question2": "Write a simple Verilog module for a 16-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) that takes a 16-bit input vector and a 4-bit select signal to produce a single-bit output",
    "question3": "Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module. Use as many high-level concepts that are directly applicable to describe the code, say at the level of an undergraduate EECS major, but do not include extraneous details that arenâ€™t immediately applicable. Use text-based truth tables and state transition graphs when necessary. Speak concisely as if this was a specification for a circuit designer to implement. You should only reply with descriptive natural language and not use any code",
    "question4": "Generate a 4-bit binary counter with synchronous reset. The counter should increment by one on each clock cycle and reset to zero when a reset signal is asserted. The Verilog code should be synthesizable and meet the following constraints: (1) Input: reset (active high), (2) Output: count (4-bit).",
    "question5": "Provide a step-by-step guide on setting up a design rule check (DRC) using Cadence Virtuoso for a 7nm technology node.",
    "question6": "Can you explain how to run the Cadence Virtuoso UltraSim 64-bit software?",
    "question7": "Design a verilog module name is data_acquisition using Xilinx BRAM macro name is xpm_memory_spram to store 8-bit sensor data. The sensor data is received in one clock domain, and it needs to be stored in the BRAM macro using another clock domain. Utilize a Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) macro name is xpm_cdc_array_single with inputs for the source clock (clk_src), destination clock (clk_dest), and asynchronous reset (rst). The CDC macro should take an 8-bit input (data_in) and provide an 8-bit synchronized output (data_out) to store in BRAM macro. Configure the synchronizer with specific parameters: a destination synchronizer flip-flop of depth 4, no initial synchronization flip-flop, no simulation assertion checks, source input register enabled, and a data width of 8 bits. xpm_memory_spram macro with inputs for write enable (write_enable), clock (clk), and reset (reset). The output of the BRAM macro should be the data read from the RAM (ram_data). This system allows for the secure transfer of sensor data between different clock domains while utilizing Xilinx BRAM for efficient data storage on the based on write enable and input write address",
    "question8": "Create a Verilog testbench for a 4-bit adder module that can automatically verify the correctness of all possible input combinations?",
    "question9": "I encountered the following error message in Synopsys VCS: 'Error: VCS0001. What does it mean, and how can I resolve it?",
    "question10": "How do I configure the memory compiler in Synopsys Custom Compiler for a high-density SRAM design?",
    "question11": "Can you explain how to use the Cadence Virtuoso Layout Suite's automation features, such as auto-routing and constraint-driven layout, to improve layout efficiency for a complex RF module?",
    "question12": "Can you provide a step-by-step guide for installing and configuring Cadence Virtuoso for the first time on a Linux system, including setting up the necessary environment variables?"
